                <p>Python has been in the TOP 3 most popular programming languages ​​for several years in a row. This is objective data from Stackoverflow, a question and answer system for programmers around the world.</p> <br><br>

                <p>Many programmers begin their development journey with this. One of the reasons for this phenomenon is considered to be the lack of need for a deep understanding of other languages.</p> <br><br>

                <h4>What do specialists do?</h4>
                <p>The Python programming language is distinguished by its simplicity both in learning and in interacting with it. Experts use its capabilities almost everywhere:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web development:</strong> The language has several popular frameworks like Django and Flask. They simplify code writing, tool management, and the entire application lifecycle. They include a CMS, ready-made authorization systems, and tools for working with databases. Django is the choice of most programmers to complete their daily tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mathematical calculations:</strong> Tools like Matplotlib and seaborn translate information from two-dimensional graphics into visuals, and SciPy is used for scientific and engineering calculations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Software:</strong> Using the internal tkinter library, you can develop software for any OS. Due to the high performance of the language itself, this process is convenient to implement.</li>
                    <li><strong>AI:</strong> It takes just a few lines of code to create a ready-made AI with a self-learning system. It’s easy to translate Python code into C++ for faster execution, making the language even simpler and more ideal for work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automation:</strong> Writing necessary scripts can automate all the work. They can also be adapted for other tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine learning:</strong> By loading initial and final data of an array, a matrix can work to provide the desired answer. Algorithms can be taught to find patterns in different values to achieve the desired results independently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Deep learning:</strong> This type of machine learning, based on learning representations rather than algorithms, creates complex systems similar to human neural connections. It automates many data processing tasks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Administration:</strong> Administrators can automate workflows using the Bash command shell.</li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </ul>

                <p>Python developers typically specialize in creating various products to meet project goals. This often involves developing the entire server side of web applications. A successful specialist can efficiently manage all stages - planning, writing scalable code, testing, and bringing the product to market. The programmer must have extensive experience in managing projects and adapt to all conditions of its creation.</p>
